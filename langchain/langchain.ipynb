It involves drilling a wellbore at a pressure lower than the surrounding formation pressure. This is done by creating a partial vacuum in the wellbore, which reduces the hydrostatic pressure of the drilling fluid and allows for the well to be drilled in a controlled manner.\\n\\nUnderpressure drilling is typically used in situations where the formation pressure is too high for conventional drilling methods to be used safely. This could be due to the presence of highly pressurized reservoirs or shallow gas zones. It is also commonly used in depleted reservoirs where the formation pressure has decreased over time.\\n\\nThe process of underpressure drilling involves using specialized equipment such as a downhole underpressure valve and a surface-controlled underpressure valve to create and maintain the desired level of underpressure in the wellbore. The underpressure valves are designed to regulate the flow of drilling fluid and maintain the desired underpressure level.\\n\\nOne of the key benefits of underpressure drilling is that it allows for the safe and efficient drilling of high-pressure formations, which would otherwise be too risky or costly to drill using conventional methods. It also helps to reduce the risk of well control issues such as blowouts.\\n\\nHowever, underpressure drilling also has'"

In the context of petroleum engineering, capillary pressure plays a crucial role in the flow of fluids in reservoir rocks and is a key factor in determining the amount of oil or gas that can be recovered from a reservoir.\\n\\nCapillary pressure is affected by several factors, including the properties of the liquid and the solid, the size and distribution of the pores, and the interfacial tension between the liquid and solid phases. It can be measured experimentally by taking a core sample from the reservoir and subjecting it to different levels of pressure to determine the amount of liquid held in the pores at each pressure.\\n\\nIn petroleum engineering, capillary pressure is important because it controls the distribution of fluids in a reservoir. A higher capillary pressure means that more fluid will be held in the pores, making it more difficult for the fluid to flow through the rock and be produced.

      "Summary: The petroleum industry, also known as the oil industry, includes the global processes of exploration, extraction, refining, transportation (often by oil tankers and pipelines), and marketing of petroleum products. The largest volume products of the industry are fuel oil and gasoline (petrol). Petroleum is also the raw material for many chemical products, including pharmaceuticals, solvents, fertilizers, pesticides, synthetic fragrances, and plastics.  The industry is usually divided into three major components: upstream, midstream, and downstream. Upstream regards exploration and extraction of crude oil, midstream encompasses transportation and storage of crude, and downstream concerns refining crude oil into various end products.\n",
      "Petroleum is vital to many industries, and is necessary for the maintenance of industrial civilization in its current configuration, making it a critical concern for many nations. Oil accounts for a large percentage of the world's energy consumption, ranging from a low of 32% for Europe and Asia, to a high of 53% for the Middle East.\n",
      "Other geographic regions' consumption patterns are as follows: South and Central America (44%), Africa (41%), and North America (40%). The world consumes 36 billion barrels (5.8 km3) of oil per year, with developed nations being the largest consumers. The United States consumed 18% of the oil produced in 2015. The production, distribution, refining, and retailing of petroleum taken as a whole represents the world's largest industry in terms of dollar value.\n",

      "Summary: The oil and gas industry is usually divided into three major sectors: upstream, midstream, and downstream. The downstream sector is the refining of petroleum crude oil and the processing and purifying of raw natural gas, as well as the marketing and distribution of products derived from crude oil and natural gas. The downstream sector reaches consumers through products such as gasoline or petrol, kerosene, jet fuel, diesel oil, heating oil, fuel oils, lubricants, waxes, asphalt, natural gas, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as well as naphtha and hundreds of petrochemicals.\n",
      "Midstream operations are often included in the downstream category and are considered to be a part of the downstream sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: History of the petroleum industry\n",
      "Summary: While the local use of oil goes back many centuries, the modern petroleum industry along with its outputs and modern applications are of a recent origin. Petroleum's status as a key component of politics, society, and technology has its roots in the coal and kerosene industry of the late nineteenth century. One of the earliest instances of this is the refining of paraffin from crude oil. Abraham Gesner developed a process to refine a liquid fuel (which he would later call kerosene) from coal, bitumen and oil shale; it burned more cleanly and was cheaper than whale oil. James Young in 1847 noticed a natural petroleum seepage when he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil, at the same time obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery. The world's first refineries and modern oil wells were established in the mid-nineteenth century. While petroleum industries developed in several countries during the nineteenth century, the two giants were the United States and the Russian Empire, specifically that part of it that today forms the territory of independent Azerbaijan. Together, these two countries produced 97% of the world's oil over the course of the nineteenth century.\n",
      "The use of the internal combustion engine for automobiles and trucks in the turn of the twentieth century was a critical factor in the explosive growth of the industry in the United States, Europe, Middle East and later the rest of the world. When diesel fuel replaced steam engines in warships, control of oil supplies became a factor in military strategy—and played a key role in World War II. After the\u001b[0m\n",
